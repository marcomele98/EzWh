# Project Estimation  
Date: 10 April 2022

Version: 1.0


# Estimation approach
Consider the EZWH  project as described in YOUR requirement document, assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course
# Estimate by size
### 
|             | Estimate                        |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |  
| NC =  Estimated number of classes to be developed   |        42                   |             
|  A = Estimated average size per class, in LOC       |        500                    | 
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC * A) | 21000 |         
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)  |            2100                    |   
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro) | 63000 | 
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) |   13,2            |               

# Estimate by product decomposition
### 
|         component name    | Estimated effort (person hours)   |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | 
|requirement document   | 60 |
| GUI prototype | 40 |
|design document | 50 |
|code | 1500 |
| unit tests | 500 |
| api tests | 500 |
| management documents  | 70 |



# Estimate by activity decomposition
### 
|         Activity name    | Estimated effort (person hours)   |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | 
| Define stakeholders  | 4 |
|

# Summary

Report here the results of the three estimation approaches. The  estimates may differ. Discuss here the possible reasons for the difference

|             | Estimated effort                        |   Estimated duration |          
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------|
| estimate by size | 2100 | 13,2
| estimate by product decomposition | 2720 | 17
